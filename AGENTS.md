## Code Formatting

### Blank Lines
- Do NOT add tabs or spaces on blank/empty lines
- Blank lines should be completely empty (no whitespace characters)
- This applies to blank lines within docstrings, function bodies, and between code blocks

### Example - Correct:
```python
def example():
    """Short description.

    Longer description here.
    """
    pass
```

### Example - Incorrect:
```python
def example():
    """Short description.
    
    Longer description here.
    """
    pass
```
Note: The incorrect example has invisible tabs/spaces on the blank line within the docstring.
